Overview
--------

raytrace is a unimaginitive name for a raytracing harness. It's used in
CSU Fullerton's computer graphics course to help students get started.
See COPYING for license terms.

To build the software, you'll need GNU Make and BASH. BASH is needed to
run config/config.guess. Platform specific makefiles are located
in config.

This project requires GFXMath.h. This is an exercise that students complete
in CPSC 484 -- Principles of Computer Graphics. The starting point for
this header-only library is
<https://github.com/mshafae/CS484SampleCode/tree/master/GFXMath>.

This project uses FreeImage to write bitmaps. If your installation does
not already have this library installed, you can find pre-built binaries
at <https://gamble.ecs.fullerton.edu/resources>. If you use a
Debian-style GNU/Linux environment, scripts for installing the required
packages are available on the aforementioned page.
